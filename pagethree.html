    <p>I remember the first time I got a laptop in my household. My mom was going back to school and we had to get the Internet by holding a yellow ethernet cable in the laptop.</p>
    <p>Being the older child in my house meant I could use the laptop more, but acess to the sites I used now, let's just say was very limited.</p>
    <p>It took us a long time to actually get wireless Internet without going to my grandpa's house, going on YouTube without supervision.</p>
